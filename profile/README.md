OpenRobotLab is actively exploring a path to building general embodied intelligent systems through high-fidelity simulation and real-world interaction. We focus on six main research fields:

- :robot: **Humanoids and Motion Intelligence**: Development of algorithms and control systems that enable humanoid robots to move naturally and adapt to various environments.

- :hand: **Manipulation and Navigation Intelligence**: Creation of AI systems that can understand and manipulate objects while navigating complex environments. 

- :hammer_and_wrench: **Simulation/Hardware Platforms for Embodied AI**: Construction and maintenance of simulation environments and hardware platforms that support embodied AI development and testing.

- ï¿½ **AIGC for Embodied AI**: Development of AI-generated content for embodied systems to enhance robot learning and adaptation capabilities.

- :eyes: **3D Vision and Embodied Perception**: Development of computer vision systems that enable robots to perceive and understand their three-dimensional environment in real-time.

- ðŸ§ **Foundation Models for Embodied AI**: Creation of large-scale pre-trained models designed specifically for embodied intelligence to enable cross-task and cross-environment transfer learning.
